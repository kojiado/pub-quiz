## Technologies Used

The Pub Quiz App is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for developing server-rendered web applications.

- **json-server**: A simple JSON-based backend mock API for fast development and testing.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

## Installation

To run the Pub Quiz App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kojiado/pub-quiz.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
4. In a separate terminal window, start the json-server for the mock API with the following command:: `json-server db.json --port 3001`

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

Please note that for a real-world scenario, you would typically implement authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to these features. In this example, the app allows anyone to create, edit, and delete quizzes for demonstration purposes.
